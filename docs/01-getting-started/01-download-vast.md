# Download Vast Studio

## Overview

Vast Studio is an IDE just like the one you use to write code (Visual Studio Code, Jetbrains, Atom, etc). It runs as a desktop application on your machine and reads code from your file system. When you interact with resources in Vast Studio, the code on your file system is automatically updated. Similarly, if you update the code on your file system Vast Studio will instantly reflect the changes.
