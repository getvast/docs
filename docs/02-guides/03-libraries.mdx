# Libraries
Libraries are reusable modules that can be shared across apps in your workspace. They allow you to extract common functionality, such as utilities or shared business logic, into a centralized location.

## Creating Libraries
To create a library, open a Vast workspace and click on the plus icon in the left-hand Explorer window and select **New Library...**:
<Image
  alt="Create a library"
  src={CreateLib}
  retinaSrc={CreateLib2x}
  zoomSrc={CreateLibZoom}
/>

In the dialog that appears, enter a name for your library and click **Save**.

## Managing Library Details
You can specify additional information about a library like a Readme file, icon and author. 
To see this information, right click on the library in the Explorer and select **Details**:

<Image
  alt="Managing library details"
  src={LibMenuDetails}
  retinaSrc={LibMenuDetails2x}
  zoomSrc={LibMenuDetailsZoom}
/>

## Configuring Dependencies

Libraries can depend on other libraries. To add a dependency, right click on the library in the Explorer and select **Dependencies**. 

A screen will appear that lists any existing dependencies and allows you to add more by clicking on the **plus +** button:

<Image
  alt="Library dependencies"
  src={LibDependency}
  retinaSrc={LibDependency2x}
  zoomSrc={LibDependencyZoom}
/>

Each dependency may have its own configuration settings. For example, a library that manages users may have settings to enable or disable Github and Facebook login methods. To configure a dependency, select it in the list and edit the settings in the right-hand sidebar:

<Image
  alt="Library dependency configuration"
  src={LibDependencyConfig}
  retinaSrc={LibDependencyConfig2x}
  zoomSrc={LibDependencyConfigZoom}
/>


## Defining Library Configuration Settings
When authoring a library you may want to provide configuration options so that consumers can customize its behaviour. For example, a library that manages users may have settings to enable or disable Github and Facebook login methods.

To define configuration settings for your library, right click on the library in the Explorer and select **Configuration**.

<Image
  alt="Library configuration settings"
  src={LibConfig}
  retinaSrc={LibConfig2x}
  zoomSrc={LibConfigZoom}
/>

## Renaming Libraries
It's not currently possible to rename a library through Vast, but you can manually rename the library through your IDE.

## Deleting Libraries

A library can be deleted by right-clicking on the library in the Explorer and selecting **Delete**.
